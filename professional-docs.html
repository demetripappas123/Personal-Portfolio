                        <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

                        <p>I am writing to apply as a Web and Mobile Development Intern at U.S. Hunger. I am currently a computer science major at the University of Central Florida, and I hope to pursue a career in software development. I am eager to expand my experience in full-stack development technologies through hands-on experience. My strong technological skills, desire to work and lead teams, and analytical thinking ability will allow me to be a strong contributor to a software application development team at U.S. Hunger.</p>

                        <p>I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work directly with the senior developer on mobile app development with Wordpress, PHP scripting, and Flutter for UI/UX, as these are technologies I have implemented in my own projects. I am also eager to glean as much knowledge, experience and insight as possible from the senior developer I will be working with on backend technologies and API integration; I have experience integrating APIs for secure transactions, data-synchronization with SQL and noSQL databases, and RESTful APIs, and I am eager to expand my skill set.</p>

                        <p>My experiences with personal projects, available on public GitHub repositories, have prepared me to be a successful web and mobile developer. With DevConnect, I integrated a blog section using Wordpress and PHP scripts to allow users to write and customize their own blogs. Through this experience, I developed skills in Wordpress and PHP that allowed me to provide more aesthetically pleasing, functional, and intuitive user experiences, which I know will be especially valuable in my work for U.S. Hunger. In developing TaskFlow, a task-management app for users, I utilized Flutter widgets for versatility of front-end experience on both iOS and Android. Furthermore, I developed a mySQL based backend with API endpoints to allow for synchronization of user data across both their mobile and web accounts. I know that this experience will lend itself to be very useful in the work I would be doing with U.S Hunger.</p>

                        <p>As a Web and Mobile Development Intern at U.S. Hunger, I am excited about the opportunity to broaden my skills and work on projects. I am confident that I have the project experience and technological skills to not only navigate the technologies in the tasks at hand, but also expand my knowledge. I would welcome the chance to discuss my qualifications with you in greater detail. Please do not hesitate to contact me by email at dmetripappas@gmai.com or by phone at (941) 374-1846. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
